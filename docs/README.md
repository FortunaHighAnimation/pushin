# PushIn.js Documentation

This folder contains two types of project documentation:

1. Tutorials (which can also be used as QA test pages)
2. Detailed API reference in the form of markdown files

To build the tutorial pages on your local environment, you can either run `npm start`. This will build the website, start up a node server and automatically open it on your Chrome browser.
